# Cards Library
The cards library is a small (very small) library that simulates cards. It will be updated as needed, but for the most part, it's pretty much done as it stands. Feel free to use it if you wish to have a base point for a card game. I sure will.
## Classes
A brief overview of the classes in this library follows:
### Card.java
A card is defined as a number (or face) and a suit. Suits are of the enum Card.Suit, as there are only 4 of them, and they never change.

### Deck.java
A deck is defined as a collection (or stack, book, what have you) of cards. Any amount of cards greater than 1 is a deck (a single card would be just a single card.)
